We thought it would make sense to start with the admin view of the Women in Computing Club as that would implement more of the HTTP methods we had used in class. The admin would be able to not only view the events but also would have the ability to add/edit/delete events and members. Eventually (most likely after this class) we would add a front-end view for users which would show information about the club, the events, etc. but would not provide the ability to edit.

This site is the admin view for Calvin College's Women in Computing club site. This website gives a list of upcoming events, allows admin to create new events, view the current list of members in the club, and add new members as well. As well as edit previous events and members.

The Home page contains photos from previous events, and the About page gives some info about our club and our leadership team.
