We thought it would make sense to start with the admin view of the Women in Computing Club as that would implement more of the HTTP methods we had used in class. The admin would be able to not only view the events but also would have the ability to add/edit/delete events and members. Eventually (most likely after this class) we would add a front-end view for users which would show information about the club, the events, etc. but would not provide the ability to edit.
