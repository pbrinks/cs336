                        Node.js is used for building any server-side event-driven i/o application using JavaScript, while Express.js is a framework that goes on top of Node.js that can only be used for web developement.

                        The packages.json file contains metadata about your app, which allows npm to identify the app and handle it's dependencies.
                        </li>
